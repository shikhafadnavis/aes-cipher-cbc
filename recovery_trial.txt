WCCP V2.0 defines mechanisms to allow one or more routers enabled for
   transparent redirection to discover, verify, and advertise
   connectivity to one or more web-caches.

   Having established connectivity the routers and web-caches form
   Service Groups to handle the redirection of traffic whose
   characteristics are part of the Service Group definition.

   The protocol provides the means to negotiate the specific method
   used for load distribution among web-caches and also the method used
   to transport traffic between router and cache.

   A single web-cache within a Service Group is elected as the designated
   web-cache. It is the responsibility of the designated web-cache to
   provide routers with the data which determines how redirected traffic
   is distributed between the web-caches in the Service Group.
